    <h1>Text Formatting Examples</h1>

    <p>
      This text is <b>bold</b>. It is visually bold, but does not add extra
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This text is <b>important</b>. Screen readers will read this extra
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This text emphasized. It is a good practice to use this tag for emphasis
      instead of the.
    </p>
    <p>I want to <mark>highlight</mark> this important point.</p>
    <p>This is small text for a minor point.</p>
    <p>
      This is a <del>deleted</del> text and this is <ins>inserted</ins> text.
      This is often used for revisions.
    </p>
    <p>The chemical formula for water is H <sub>2</sub> o.(superscript)</p>
    <p>The area of a circle is $\pi r^{2}$ (Superscript)</p>
    <p>You can use a pre tag to preserve the spacing and line breaks in code or poetry, <b>like this:<pre>
  <p>   Hello, world! </p>
</pre></b></p>

    <p>You can use the <ins>u tag to underline</ins> text, but it is better to do so using <b>CSS to avoid confusion </b></p>
    <h2>My Projects</h2>
<p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project One: My First Website</strong>
    <p>A simple website I built to practice using headings, paragraphs, and lists.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Project Two: A Simple Recipe Page</strong>
    <p>A page with a list of ingredients and a set of instructions. I learned how to use both ordered and unordered lists here.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Project Three: Step-by-Step Guide to a Website</strong>.
    </p>
  <!-- <h1>Project Three: Step-by-Step Guide to a Website</h1> -->
  
<p>Here is a breakdown of how I created this page using an ordered list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Planned the structure using headings and sections.</li>
  <li>Wrote the content for each section.</li>
  <li>Added lists and formatted text for clarity.</li>
  <li>Included a form and a table for more complex data.</li>
</ol>
